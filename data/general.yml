  about_text: "Kicking off in 2016, we are ready for world domination. After working together at a coding bootcamp for quite a while we found that it was our mutual goal to create products that can really fast track much needed change. Having come from diverse backgrounds we saw how technology can change lives, and that's exactly what we are trying to establish. We thrive to give people a voice."
